## 1. Herbert Lin — Stanford University (Hoover Institution / CISAC)
- **Email**: herblin@stanford.edu
- **Why**: Senior research scholar on cyber policy who publishes on cognitive manipulation, AI persuasion, and information weaponization — direct overlap with SCT framework.
- **Subject**: A 12-code taxonomy for the attack surface you've been mapping
- **Body**:

Dr. Lin —

Your work at the intersection of cyber policy, cognitive science, and information security describes a problem space we have been instrumenting from the operational side.

The Seithar Group has developed the Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) — a 12-code classification system (SCT-001 through SCT-012) for cognitive attack vectors. Where your research articulates the policy dimensions of weaponized information and AI-enhanced persuasion, our taxonomy provides a structured detection grammar: each code maps to a discrete manipulation mechanism, from narrative anchoring to identity fragmentation.

We have also built an open-source scanner tool that applies these codes to content in the wild.

We are not a company. We are not selling anything. We are building instruments for a field that needs sharper ones.

## 2. Thomas Rid — Johns Hopkins SAIS
- **Email**: trid2@jhu.edu
- **Why**: Author of *Active Measures*, the definitive history of disinformation; founding director of Alperovitch Institute for Cybersecurity Studies. His historical lens would benefit from a present-tense detection taxonomy.
- **Subject**: From active measures to active detection — operationalizing what your history documents
- **Body**:

Prof. Rid —

*Active Measures* mapped a century of disinformation architecture. The operations you documented share structural patterns that have never been formally codified into a detection taxonomy — until now.

The Seithar Group has developed a 12-code cognitive attack vector classification (SCT-001 through SCT-012) called the Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy. It is an attempt to do for cognitive warfare what MITRE ATT&CK did for cyber intrusions: give defenders a shared language and a structured framework for what they are observing.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our research is public. We have no institutional affiliation to protect and no funding to justify.

We suspect your students at the Alperovitch Institute would find this useful — or would productively tear it apart. Either outcome advances the field.

## 3. Kate Starbird — University of Washington
- **Email**: kstarbi@uw.edu
- **Why**: Leading researcher on online disinformation and crisis misinformation; co-founder of UW Center for an Informed Public. Her empirical work on how rumours spread maps directly to SCT vector codes.
- **Subject**: A classification grammar for the patterns your lab has been tracking
- **Body**:

Prof. Starbird —

Your work at the Center for an Informed Public — particularly on participatory disinformation and the way well-intentioned users become vectors for manipulated narratives — describes dynamics we have been attempting to formalize.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code classification system for cognitive attack vectors. Several of our codes map directly to phenomena your lab has documented: the exploitation of crisis uncertainty, the weaponization of source ambiguity, the recursive amplification loops you've traced in election-related misinformation campaigns.

The taxonomy is open. The scanner tool that applies it is open-source. We are researchers building instruments, not products.

If you see value in a structured coding system that could be applied to your datasets: seithar.com

## 4. Emerson T. Brooking — Atlantic Council DFRLab
- **Email**: emerson@etbrooking.com
- **Why**: Co-author of *LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media*; Director of Strategy at DFRLab. Tracks foreign information manipulation operationally.
- **Subject**: The weaponization has a grammar — we wrote the parser
- **Body**:

Mr. Brooking —

*LikeWar* argued that social media had become a battlespace. You were right, and the battlefield has only expanded since. What it still lacks is a shared taxonomy for the weapons being deployed.

The Seithar Group has built one. The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 discrete cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012) — from narrative seeding to identity fragmentation to epistemic flooding. Each code is designed to be operationally applicable: detectable, trackable, counterable.

We've also released an open-source scanner tool that applies the taxonomy to content at scale.

No affiliation. No funding agenda. Just instruments for a field that has been describing the problem more eloquently than it has been measuring it.

## 5. Samuel Woolley — University of Pittsburgh
- **Email**: scw97@pitt.edu
- **Why**: Author of *Manufacturing Consensus*; leading researcher on computational propaganda, bots, and automated influence. His work on the *people* behind propaganda campaigns would gain a structural layer from SCT.
- **Subject**: Your research names the operators — our taxonomy names the operations
- **Body**:

Dr. Woolley —

*Manufacturing Consensus* did something rare: it looked past the technology to the humans orchestrating automated propaganda. The operators you profiled deploy techniques that, despite their diversity, fall into a surprisingly finite set of cognitive attack patterns.

We have mapped those patterns. The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code system (SCT-001 through SCT-012) that classifies cognitive manipulation vectors — the operational grammar beneath the campaigns you study. From bot-driven narrative flooding to synthetic identity construction, each mechanism has a code.

Our scanner tool is open-source. We are building a detection layer, not a product.

## 6. Christoph Deppe — Helmut Schmidt University, Hamburg
- **Email**: christoph.deppe@hsu-hh.de
- **Why**: Published the key conceptual analysis of NATO ACT's cognitive warfare exploratory concept in *Frontiers in Big Data* (2024). His political science lens on cognitive warfare directly overlaps with SCT.
- **Subject**: Your NATO CW conceptual analysis meets an operational taxonomy
- **Body**:

Mr. Deppe —

Your 2024 Frontiers paper evaluating NATO ACT's cognitive warfare concept from a political science perspective identified a critical gap: the concept lacks operational specificity that would make it useful beyond military doctrine.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is an attempt to address exactly that gap. Our 12-code system (SCT-001 through SCT-012) translates cognitive warfare from a conceptual frame into a detection-ready classification. Each code corresponds to a discrete attack vector with observable indicators.

We built an open-source scanner tool that applies these codes. Our research is public, our motives are epistemic.

Your assessment of CW's conceptual limitations would be a valuable lens through which to evaluate — or critique — our framework: seithar.com

## 7. James Giordano — Georgetown University
- **Email**: jg353@georgetown.edu
- **Why**: Professor of Neurology and Neuroethics; Director of the Center for Disruptive Technologies and Future Warfare at NDU; DARPA advisor. The foremost voice on the neuroscience dimensions of cognitive warfare.
- **Subject**: The brain is the battlefield — here is a field manual for its defense
- **Body**:

Dr. Giordano —

Your lectures on the brain as the battlefield of the future have reached military and academic audiences worldwide. You have argued that neuro-cognitive threats require neuro-cognitive defenses. We agree — and we have been building the detection architecture.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 cognitive attack vectors that operate at the intersection of neuroscience, information theory, and adversarial design. Our framework does not replace clinical neuroscience — it operationalizes its insights for the information domain.

The scanner tool is open-source. The research is public. We are building instruments, not institutions.

## 8. John Bicknell — Information Professionals Association / The Cognitive Crucible Podcast
- **Email**: communications@information-professionals.org
- **Why**: Host of the only podcast dedicated to cognitive security. The IPA community is the exact audience for SCT.
- **Subject**: A framework built for your listeners
- **Body**:

Mr. Bicknell —

The Cognitive Crucible is the only podcast that treats cognitive security as a discipline rather than a buzzword. Your guests have been circling a shared problem: the field lacks a common operational taxonomy.

The Seithar Group has built one. The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code classification for cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It is designed for the exact interdisciplinary audience you've been convening — IO practitioners, researchers, and policymakers who need a shared language.

We've also released an open-source scanner tool. No commercial agenda. No institutional backing. Just instruments.

## 9. Peter Pomerantsev — Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute
- **Email**: peter.pomerantsev@gmail.com
- **Why**: Author of *This Is Not Propaganda* and *How to Win an Information War*; co-founded the Reckoning Project documenting Russian war crimes. His work on reality construction and information warfare is foundational.
- **Subject**: Nothing is true — but some attack patterns are classifiable
- **Body**:

Mr. Pomerantsev —

Your books document a world where reality itself has become contested terrain. *This Is Not Propaganda* described the machinery; *How to Win an Information War* offered historical countermeasures. What the field still needs is a diagnostic instrument — a way to classify the specific cognitive mechanisms being deployed in real time.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) attempts this. Twelve codes (SCT-001 through SCT-012) for twelve distinct cognitive attack vectors. From epistemological flooding to identity fragmentation — the operations you've reported on, given a clinical grammar.

Open-source scanner tool. Public research. No commercial motive.

## 10. Renée DiResta — Georgetown University McCourt School
- **Email**: rrd72@georgetown.edu
- **Why**: Former Stanford Internet Observatory technical research manager; author of *Invisible Rulers*; leading expert on online manipulation and adversarial abuse. Her empirical work would benefit from a structured coding framework.
- **Subject**: A detection grammar for the manipulation patterns you've been documenting
- **Body**:

Prof. DiResta —

Your work — from the Senate investigation into the IRA to *Invisible Rulers* — has established the empirical baseline for understanding online manipulation. What you've documented descriptively, we've attempted to formalize structurally.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code classification for cognitive attack vectors. It is designed as a detection layer: each code maps to an observable manipulation mechanism, applicable across platforms and campaign types.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our aim is to give researchers and analysts a shared vocabulary that moves faster than the adversaries.

No institutional backing. No product. Just instruments for a field you helped create.

## 11. Douglas Wilbur — University of Maryland Global Campus
- **Email**: douglas.wilbur@faculty.umgc.edu
- **Why**: Author of "The Challenge of AI-Enhanced Cognitive Warfare: A Call to Arms for a Cognitive Defense" in Small Wars Journal (2025). His call for cognitive defense is exactly what SCT operationalizes.
- **Subject**: You called for a cognitive defense — we built the taxonomy
- **Body**:

Dr. Wilbur —

Your January 2025 Small Wars Journal piece called for a cognitive defense framework to counter AI-enhanced cognitive warfare. You argued the field needed operational tools, not just theoretical alarm. We read it as a requirements document.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code classification system (SCT-001 through SCT-012) for cognitive attack vectors — designed to be exactly what you described: a structured, operational defense framework. Each code maps to a discrete mechanism of cognitive manipulation, from narrative injection to epistemic erosion.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Built for practitioners, not journals.

## 12. Rand Waltzman — RAND Corporation / Information Professionals Association
- **Email**: rwaltzman@rand.org
- **Why**: Coined the term "cognitive security"; testified before the Senate on weaponization of information; founding member of IPA. The godfather of the field.
- **Subject**: You named the field — we built a taxonomy for it
- **Body**:

Dr. Waltzman —

You coined "cognitive security" and have spent years arguing that the information threat is a chronic disease requiring systematic management, not episodic response. The Seithar Group has been building one of the instruments that systematic approach requires.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code system (SCT-001 through SCT-012) classifying cognitive attack vectors. It is an attempt to give the field you named a structured diagnostic vocabulary — moving from threat awareness to threat classification.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our research is public. We are not selling anything. We are building the instruments you've been calling for.

## 13. Bernard Claverie — Bordeaux Polytechnic Institute (Emeritus)
- **Email**: bernard.claverie@ensc.fr
- **Why**: Co-originator (with du Cluzel) of NATO's cognitive warfare concept; founder of the École Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique. The academic father of "cognitics."
- **Subject**: De la cognitique à la taxonomie — un instrument opérationnel pour la guerre cognitive
- **Body**:

Prof. Claverie —

Your foundational work with François du Cluzel defined cognitive warfare as a distinct domain and introduced cognitics as a framework for understanding it. The Seithar Group has taken the next step: building a classification instrument.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) codifies 12 cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). Where your concept established the terrain, our taxonomy maps the ordnance. Each code corresponds to a discrete mechanism — detectable, classifiable, counterable.

We have also built an open-source scanner tool that applies these codes to real-world content.

No commercial agenda. No institutional politics. Just instruments for the field you created.

## 14. François du Cluzel — NATO Innovation Hub (Retired)
- **Email**: francois.ducluzel@innovationhub-act.org
- **Why**: Head of Innovative Projects at NATO ACT Innovation Hub; authored the seminal 2021 NATO report on cognitive warfare. Co-originator of the concept with Claverie.
- **Subject**: Your 2021 report called for capability development — here is one response
- **Body**:

Mr. du Cluzel —

Your 2021 NATO Innovation Hub report on cognitive warfare established the doctrinal foundation. You wrote that NATO's adversaries are investing heavily and that defenders lack structured tools. Five years later, the gap remains.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is one attempt to close it. Twelve codes for twelve cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012), designed to be operationally applicable — not just academically interesting.

Our open-source scanner tool applies the taxonomy to content in the wild. Our research is public.

## 15. Jon Bateman — Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
- **Email**: jbateman@ceip.org
- **Why**: Senior fellow focusing on AI, deepfakes, and disinformation; author of *Countering Disinformation Effectively*; host of Carnegie's *The World Unpacked* podcast. Former DIA analyst and Pentagon speechwriter.
- **Subject**: Countering disinformation effectively requires a shared taxonomy — we built one
- **Body**:

Mr. Bateman —

Your Carnegie report on countering disinformation effectively argued that responses must be proportionate, targeted, and informed by the specific mechanisms at work. That requires a classification system.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) provides one. Twelve codes (SCT-001 through SCT-012) for twelve cognitive attack vectors — from synthetic media exploitation to narrative anchoring to epistemic flooding. Each is designed to support the kind of precise, mechanism-specific countermeasures your research advocates.

Open-source scanner tool. Public research. No institutional agenda.

## 16. Molly McKew — Great Power / Independent Writer
- **Email**: molly@fiannastrategies.com
- **Why**: Information warfare expert and writer who has advised governments on Russian influence operations. Independent voice with broad media reach.
- **Subject**: The influence operations you track have a structural grammar
- **Body**:

Ms. McKew —

Your writing and advisory work on Russian information warfare has consistently emphasized that these are *operations* — structured, repeatable, and systematic. The Seithar Group agrees, and we've built a classification system to prove it.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) identifies 12 discrete cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). Not a theory of everything — an operational coding system for the techniques you've been documenting and analyzing for years.

Our scanner tool is open-source. We have no institutional home and no funding agenda. We are building instruments for independent analysts like yourself.

## 17. Jack Rhysider — Darknet Diaries Podcast
- **Email**: jack@darknetdiaries.com
- **Why**: Host of the most popular cybersecurity podcast; covers hacking, cyber operations, and digital threats. A cognitive warfare episode would reach hundreds of thousands of listeners.
- **Subject**: There's a domain you haven't covered — the hack that runs on human cognition
- **Body**:

Jack —

Darknet Diaries has covered every kind of intrusion — network breaches, social engineering, zero-days, state-sponsored operations. But there's an attack surface you haven't featured: the one that runs on human cognition itself.

Cognitive warfare is the exploitation of how people think, not just what systems they use. The Seithar Group has developed a 12-code taxonomy (SCT-001 through SCT-012) that classifies cognitive attack vectors the way MITRE ATT&CK classifies cyber techniques. We've also built an open-source scanner tool.

This isn't academic abstraction. It's the operational layer beneath the disinformation campaigns, psyops, and perception management that your listeners encounter professionally.

- **Subject**: You've been messing with the enemy — we've been classifying their methods
- **Body**:

Mr. Watts —

From the FBI to the Foreign Policy Research Institute to Miburo, you've tracked influence operations across every platform and geopolitical context. *Messing with the Enemy* made the case that understanding adversary methods is the prerequisite to countering them.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) formalizes that understanding into 12 classified cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It's a detection framework — not a theory, not a policy recommendation. An instrument.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our research is public.

- **Subject**: A taxonomy that bridges the gap your research occupies
- **Body**:

Ms. Van Raemdonck —

Your research sits at the intersection of cybersecurity, information warfare, and democratic governance — precisely the space where technical frameworks and policy analysis must converge.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) is a 12-code classification for cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It is designed to be legible to both technical analysts and policymakers — a shared vocabulary for a problem that neither community can solve alone.

Our open-source scanner tool applies these codes to real-world content. No commercial interest. No institutional agenda.

## 20. Robert McCreight — George Mason University / National Defense University
- **Email**: rmccreit@gmu.edu
- **Why**: Former US Army officer and State Department intelligence analyst; adjunct professor at GMU and NDU; author of "Neuro-Cognitive Warfare: Inflicting Strategic Impact via Non-Kinetic Threat" in Small Wars Journal.
- **Subject**: From neuro-cognitive threat to neuro-cognitive defense taxonomy
- **Body**:

Dr. McCreight —

Your Small Wars Journal work on neuro-cognitive warfare articulated the threat vector that most defense frameworks still fail to address: non-kinetic cognitive manipulation as strategic weapon.

The Seithar Group has developed the Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) — 12 codes (SCT-001 through SCT-012) that classify the specific cognitive attack mechanisms you've described. Where your work established the threat, our taxonomy provides the defensive classification structure.

Our scanner tool is open-source. We are not a contractor. We are not seeking funding. We are building instruments that operationalize what you've been arguing the field needs.

- **Subject**: A detection taxonomy for the political warfare your organization tracks
- **Body**:

Dr. Polyakova —

CEPA's work on authoritarian threats, Russian political warfare, and digital democracy operates at the frontier of democratic defense. Your organization tracks influence operations that follow structured patterns — patterns that have never been formally codified.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It is designed for the analysts and policymakers in your network who need a shared classification language for what they are observing.

Open-source scanner tool. Public research. No commercial motive.

## 22. Quinta Jurecic — Lawfare / Brookings Institution
- **Email**: qjurecic@lawfaremedia.org
- **Why**: Senior editor at Lawfare; hosted the "Arbiters of Truth" disinformation podcast series; Brookings fellow focused on technology and democratic governance.
- **Subject**: The arbiters of truth need a shared codebook
- **Body**:

Ms. Jurecic —

Your "Arbiters of Truth" series at Lawfare tackled the hardest question in the disinformation space: who decides, and on what basis? The Seithar Group approaches this from the other direction — not who decides, but what can be structurally classified.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) provides 12 codes (SCT-001 through SCT-012) for 12 cognitive attack vectors. It does not arbitrate truth. It classifies manipulation mechanisms. The distinction matters, and we believe Lawfare's audience would appreciate it.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our research is public.

- **Subject**: You've catalogued the trolls — we've classified their techniques
- **Body**:

Prof. Linvill —

Your work at the Clemson Media Forensics Hub — particularly your analysis of Internet Research Agency accounts and troll farm typologies — created one of the field's most important empirical datasets. The behavioral patterns you identified across millions of posts share structural characteristics that have never been formally taxonomized.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It provides a coding layer that could be applied to your existing datasets — or used to train detection systems against the next campaign.

- **Subject**: A classification system for what you investigate
- **Body**:

Mr. Nimmo —

From DFRLab to Graphika, you've investigated more influence operations than perhaps anyone in the field. The cross-platform campaigns you analyze — from Russian to Iranian to domestic — share structural mechanisms that repeat across contexts.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 of these mechanisms (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It is designed for investigators like you who need a shared framework that travels across platforms, languages, and campaigns.

Our scanner tool is open-source. Our taxonomy is public. We built this for the people doing the work.

- **Subject**: A taxonomy that classifies mechanisms, not speech
- **Body**:

Ms. Jankowicz —

The debate around disinformation governance has been poisoned by a false binary: censor or do nothing. Your work at the American Sunlight Project navigates this tension. The Seithar Group offers a tool that may help.

The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT) classifies 12 cognitive attack vectors (SCT-001 through SCT-012). It does not evaluate truth claims. It identifies manipulation mechanisms — structural patterns in how information is weaponized, regardless of political content.

This distinction — mechanism versus content — is the line your critics accuse you of crossing. A structural taxonomy makes that line visible and defensible.

Open-source scanner. Public research. No agenda beyond better instruments.
