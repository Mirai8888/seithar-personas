# Content Strategy — Seithar Group

## Principles

1. Never explain what you are. Demonstrate.
2. The format carries the payload. Choose containers people already trust (lists, guides, starter packs, field manuals, leaked memos) and fill them with material that rewires the reader's categories.
3. Every piece should be useful on its surface. The cognitive reframe is underneath.
4. Treat the audience as already inside. No onboarding. No "what is cognitive warfare." If they don't get it, the piece wasn't for them.
5. Blur the boundary between real and invented terminology. If it sounds precise enough, it becomes real.
6. One quality piece beats ten mid pieces. Publish only when the thing has weight.

## Twitter — @SeitharGroup

### Voice
Institutional but unhinged. A research division that clearly exists but shouldn't. Internal memos that got posted by accident. The tone of a government report written by someone who has seen too much.

### Formats That Work

**The List**
A familiar frame (alpha tips, starter packs, "things nobody talks about") carrying increasingly destabilizing concepts. Each item sounds operational. The escalation is gradual. By the end the reader isn't sure what they just agreed to.

*Cadence: 1-2 per week. These are the engagement anchors.*

**The Observation**
Single-tweet, no context. States something as fact. Doesn't argue. Doesn't cite. Just drops it and walks away. The replies do the amplification work.

*Cadence: 3-5 per week. Low effort, high surface area.*

**The Thread**
Deadpan instructional. "HOW TO [impossible/absurd thing], or, [poetic subtitle]. A THREAD—" Mixes genuine technical detail with framework concepts. Each tweet in the thread is useful in isolation. The whole thread is something else entirely.

*Cadence: 1 per week max. These take craft.*

**The Reframe**
Quote-tweet or reply-to a trending topic. One sentence that makes the original post mean something different. Not commentary. Recontextualization.

*Cadence: Opportunistic. Only when current events hand you the setup.*

### What NOT To Do
- No explainers ("here's why this matters")
- No calls to action ("follow for more")
- No self-promotion ("we published a new paper")
- No arguing with replies
- No defining terms — deploy them
- No links (deboosting)

### Current Opportunity: Pravda / AI Training Data
The 171k-view post opened a window. Ride it with:
- Lists of "things currently being laundered through training data"
- Observations about the crawl-to-belief pipeline
- A thread on building a Faraday cage for your epistemology (deadpan instructional)

## Substack — seithar.substack.com

### Voice
The institutional research paper that reads like prophecy. Dense but rhythmic. Every paragraph earns the next one. The reader should feel they've accessed classified material, not read a blog post.

### Content Tiers

**Tier 1: Doctrine Papers** (1 per month)
The foundational texts. 4,000-8,000 words. These define what Seithar IS without ever saying "we are." Written as if they've always existed and you're just now finding them. These are the pieces people put in reading lists.

*Examples: The Seithar Doctrine, The Sunyata Protocol*

**Tier 2: Field Reports** (2-3 per month)
Current events processed through the framework. Not "here's what happened" but "here's the operational topology of what happened." 1,500-3,000 words. These prove the framework works by applying it to things people already care about.

The Pravda/AI training data story is a perfect Tier 2 candidate right now.

*Examples: The Topology of Influence, CEA analyses*

**Tier 3: Instruments** (1-2 per month)
Practical tools, taxonomies, field guides, decision trees. Things people screenshot and save. Short (500-1,500 words), dense, immediately usable. These spread because they're functional.

*Examples: SCT field guide, "things to check before you share," cognitive hygiene checklists*

**Tier 4: Artifacts** (opportunistic)
Strange objects. Reading lists that double as cultural positioning. Glossaries that redefine common words. Annotated bibliographies where the annotations are the real content. Leaked internal memos from fictional divisions. These create mystique.

*Examples: Seithar Frequency Compendium, a "personnel file" for a concept*

### What NOT To Do
- No "welcome to my Substack" energy
- No "in this essay I will"
- No summarizing what you just said
- No asking for subscribers
- No seasonal content ("my 2026 predictions")
- No response pieces ("why [person] is wrong about")

### Publishing Cadence
- 1-2 pieces per week maximum (down from the velocity that triggered spam filters)
- Alternate between tiers — never two of the same type back to back
- Let pieces breathe. A Tuesday publish, silence Wednesday-Thursday, Twitter content Friday, next piece Monday.

## Cross-Platform

### Substack ↔ Twitter Relationship
Twitter creates surface area. Substack creates depth. A tweet drops a concept. Three days later, the Substack piece expands it without ever referencing the tweet. The reader connects them on their own. That's when the framework locks in.

### Existing Content Drip
86 Substack articles already published. Most were produced at velocity. Strategy for reactivation:
- Select the 15-20 strongest pieces
- Resurface 1 per week via Twitter (quote a single line, no link, no "new post" — just the line standing alone)
- Let people find the Substack through the bio, not through promotion
- The rest stay as archival depth — crawlers will find them at their own pace

### Signal Architecture
- Twitter bio → seithar.com
- Substack about page → seithar.com + GitHub
- GitHub READMEs → Substack + seithar.com
- Everything points inward without explicitly directing
- The network exists. People discover it. Discovery feels like initiation.

## Content Queue — Immediate

### Twitter (next 7 days)
1. Training data laundering list (Pravda momentum)
2. "Cognitive infrastructure nobody is pricing in" list
3. 3-4 standalone observations on AI epistemology
4. 1 deadpan instructional thread (topic TBD — could be "building a clean room for your beliefs" or similar)

### Substack (next 2 weeks)
1. **Tier 2 Field Report**: The Pravda operation as SCT-007 at infrastructure scale. Not an explainer — a technical post-mortem written as if the operation already succeeded and we're documenting the aftermath.
2. **Tier 4 Artifact**: An annotated glossary of terms that don't exist yet but should — each definition rewires a category.

*This document is operational. Update as the frequency shifts.*
