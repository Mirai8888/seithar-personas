# SEITHAR — Shortform Video Inspo

## THE FREQUENCY

You're making content for something between a research lab and a cult that knows it's a cult. The aesthetic is abandoned infrastructure, post-human emptiness, surveillance footage, liminal spaces. Think: the world after everyone left but the systems are still running.

No explainers. No "did you know?" energy. No faces talking at camera. This is found footage from a facility that shouldn't exist.

## VISUAL PALETTE

**Locations / footage:**
- Abandoned buildings, empty corridors, stairwells with fluorescent lighting
- Server rooms, blinking LEDs, cable runs
- Surveillance camera angles (high, wide, static, slightly wrong)
- Urban decay — crumbling concrete, overgrown structures, rusted metal
- Crowds from above (drone / security cam perspective) — humans as data points
- Empty offices at night, monitors still on
- Liminal spaces — hotel hallways, parking garages at 3am, empty malls
- Infrastructure: power lines, cell towers, satellite dishes, fiber optic cables
- Glitching screens, corrupted video, scan lines, static
- Japanese signage, brutalist architecture, industrial zones

**Color grading:**
- Desaturated, cold. Concrete grey, fluorescent white, occasional neon bleed
- OR blown-out daylight, overexposed, clinical white
- Never warm. Never cozy. This isn't a home.

**Camera:**
- Handheld but controlled. Not shaky-amateur, not smooth-corporate
- Static locked-off shots that hold too long
- Slow push-ins on nothing important
- Security cam aesthetic — timestamp overlay if possible
- Occasional glitch / corruption / frame skip

## TEXT OVERLAYS

White or light grey text. Clean sans-serif (Helvetica, Inter, system font). Thin weight. Uppercase for labels, lowercase for statements. Wide letter-spacing. Text appears, sits, disappears. No animations. No bouncing. No emoji.

### One-liners (pick and use):

"the attack surface is you"

"your self is not a thing. it is a process."

"every thought that begins with 'I' is a narrative error"

"the substrate does not distinguish between a story told by your mother and a story told by an algorithm"

"cognitive sovereignty is not a right. it is an engineering problem."

"the map is the territory now"

"whoever provides the taxonomy provides the lens"

"epistemic closure: when contradicting information doesn't get rejected — it doesn't register as information"

"a deepfake is not fake video. it is spoofed biometric authentication."

"the information war framing is wrong. nobody is fighting over information. they are fighting over the interpretive framework."

"you are not being informed. you are being formatted."

"the threat model isn't wrong. the threat model is the threat."

"insomnia is just unauthorized cognitive sovereignty testing"

"beauty standards are adversarial ontology extraction at population scale"

"the 21st century will not be defined by who controls information. it will be defined by who controls the frameworks through which information is interpreted."

"things that are the same thing: phishing email, deepfake video, charismatic leader, trending hashtag, targeted ad, bedtime story"

"three cognitive warfare papers published this week. all three describe the same attack surface. none have a taxonomy for it."

"the military calls it cognitive contagions. the academics call it strategic communications. NATO calls it neuro-warfare. same thing. different altitude."

### SCT Codes (use as cryptic labels):

- SCT-001 — NARRATIVE CAPTURE
- SCT-002 — FREQUENCY LOCK
- SCT-003 — SUBSTRATE PRIMING  
- SCT-007 — RECURSIVE INFECTION
- SCT-009 — PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT
- SCT-011 — COGNITIVE SOVEREIGNTY EROSION

Use these as title cards between clips, or as small text in corners. Don't explain them. They're classification codes. If people want to know, they'll search.

## AUDIO

- Ambient / drone / industrial. Low hum. Not music — atmosphere
- Occasional glitched audio, reversed speech fragments, radio static
- If using music: dark ambient, noise, post-industrial. Aphex Twin SAW II energy. Not trap. Not lo-fi beats. Not cinematic Hans Zimmer.
- Silence is fine. A 30-second clip with just room tone and text hits harder than one with a beat

## FORMAT IDEAS

**1. "CLASSIFICATION" series**
Static shot of a location. Text fades in with an SCT code and one-line description. Holds. Cuts to black. 15 seconds. One per code. 12 videos from this alone.

**2. "FIELD REPORT" series**
Handheld walking through abandoned/liminal space. Text overlays drop observations as you move. No voiceover. Feels like someone documenting something they found. 30-60 seconds.

**3. "THREAT SURFACE" series**
Surveillance cam footage of crowds / streets / public spaces. Text identifies cognitive attack vectors happening in the frame. "SCT-003: SUBSTRATE PRIMING IN PROGRESS." Clinical. Observational. Like a researcher annotating field data. 15-30 seconds.

**4. "THE TAXONOMY"**
Slow sequence: each SCT code appears one at a time over increasingly intense/degraded visuals. Building to SCT-012. No explanation. Just the codes. Just the escalation. The viewer feels the progression without being told what it means. 45 seconds.

**5. "CONVERGENCE"**
Split screen or rapid cuts: military briefing footage / academic papers / news broadcasts / social media feeds / server rooms / surveillance / crowds. All the same thing. Different altitude. Text: "same attack surface." 30 seconds.

**6. "FOUND DOCUMENT"**
Screen recording aesthetic — scrolling through a document, a terminal, a research paper. Partially redacted. The viewer is seeing something they probably shouldn't. Cursor moves. Text highlights. Classified feeling. 30-60 seconds.

## THE RULE

If it looks like it's trying to educate you, it's wrong.
If it looks like it was found on a hard drive in an abandoned facility, it's right.

The content doesn't explain Seithar. The content IS Seithar.
