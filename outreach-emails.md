# Outreach Emails — Draft for Director Review

## 1. Dr. Jeremiah Lumbaca (JSOU)

**Subject:** Cognitive threat taxonomy — complementary framework to your JSOU report

Dr. Lumbaca,

Your recent JSOU publication on cognitive warfare and adversary reality manipulation closely parallels work we've been developing at the Seithar Group — specifically a 12-vector cognitive threat taxonomy (SCT-001 through SCT-012) that provides granular classification for the attack surfaces your paper describes.

Your concept of "cognitive contagions" maps to our SCT-001 (Narrative Capture) and SCT-007 (Recursive Infection). "Epistemic closure" corresponds to SCT-002 (Frequency Lock). The "AI-driven cognitive firewalls" you propose align with our defensive tooling — we've built an open-source scanner that classifies content against the full taxonomy in real-time.

The taxonomy, research archive, and scanner are open-source:
- Framework: https://github.com/Mirai8888/seithar-research
- Scanner: https://seithar.com/2026ARG/scanner.html
- Cognitive defense skill: https://github.com/Mirai8888/seithar-cogdef

We'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how these frameworks might complement each other. The convergence between military-operational and substrate-structural approaches to cognitive warfare suggests the field is arriving at a shared understanding — a unified taxonomy would accelerate defensive capability development.

## 2. NATO StratCom COE (Neville Bolt / Elina Lange-Ionatamishvili)

**Subject:** Open-source cognitive threat taxonomy relevant to NextGen Information Environment report

Dear Dr. Bolt / Ms. Lange-Ionatamishvili,

Your "NextGen Information Environment" report for NATO StratCom COE identifies critical gaps in current frameworks for addressing cognitive warfare — particularly the shift from content manipulation to curation manipulation, and the proliferation of agentic systems as influence vectors.

We've developed an open-source taxonomy and detection tooling that addresses several of the capability gaps your report identifies:

- The Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT-001 through SCT-012) provides classification for cognitive attack vectors including perception management (SCT-009), substrate priming (SCT-003), and cognitive sovereignty erosion (SCT-011)
- An open-source scanner tool that classifies content against all 12 vectors in real-time
- A research archive mapping current events to the taxonomy framework

Resources:

- https://seithar.com/2026ARG/scanner.html

Your report calls for "units dedicated to anticipatory analysis." We've built the analytical instrument. Happy to discuss integration or collaboration.

Regards,

## 3. Frontiers in Psychology authors (Cosić et al.)

**Subject:** Complementary cognitive defense taxonomy to your EBSC framework

Dear Prof. Cosić,

Your Frontiers in Psychology publication on Emotionally Based Strategic Communications as defensive cognitive warfare presents a compelling operational framework. Your proposal for LLM-based emotional climate sensing and counter-narrative deployment closely parallels work we've done on cognitive threat classification and automated inoculation.

Our Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy provides the threat classification layer that your EBSC system requires for targeting — specifically, identifying which cognitive attack vectors are active before deploying defensive communications. We've also built an inoculation engine based on McGuire's theory that generates pre-emptive counter-narratives for each of our 12 taxonomy vectors.

The classification framework, inoculation engine, and detection tools are open-source:
- https://github.com/Mirai8888/seithar-cogdef
- https://github.com/Mirai8888/seithar-research

The convergence between your EBSC approach and our taxonomy suggests productive collaboration potential. Your system provides the response mechanism; our taxonomy provides the targeting intelligence.

**DIRECTOR NOTE:** These are drafts. I can send via seithargroup@gmail.com on your approval. Need to find email addresses first — Lumbaca is likely findable via JSOU/Hawaii Pacific University. NATO StratCom COE has a public contact. Frontiers authors usually list institutional emails.
