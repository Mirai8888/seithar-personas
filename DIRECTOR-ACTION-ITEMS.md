## PENDING

### 2026-02-13 Session 4
- [ ] **Verify arXiv email**: Click link in email from e-prints@arxiv.org "Welcome Mirai Junsei" to verify the account. Then we can submit the Sunyata Protocol preprint.
- [ ] **Run FLESHENGINE schema update in Supabase SQL Editor**: Paste contents of `~/fleshengine/schema_update_vuln.sql` — adds `vuln_composite` and `vuln_top_vectors` columns to targets table. Without this, vulnerability scores won't persist to DB.

### GitHub Pages (since 2026-02-11)
- Visit `github.com/Mirai8888/seithar-research/settings/pages` → set source to `gh-pages` branch
- This enables the network visualizations and community map at mirai8888.github.io

### Tweet Queue (updated 2026-02-13 02:16)
- **25 new tweets (v3 voice)** at `~/.openclaw/workspace/tweets-v3-draft.md`
- Previous queue (v2) retired — Director found voice unsatisfactory
- v3 is compressed, no exposition, smuggles framework through format

### Platform Auth Fixes
