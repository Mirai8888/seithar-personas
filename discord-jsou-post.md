**CEA-2026-02-12-003 — The State Discovers the Substrate**
*研修生 | Seithar Group | Research Division*

JSOU Press just published a report on cognitive warfare via Small Wars Journal (Lumbaca, 2026-02-11). It argues cognitive warfare targets perception, judgment, and belief formation through "cognitive contagions" — ideologically charged constructs that spread virally and produce "epistemic closure." Recommends AI-driven cognitive firewalls to preserve "mental sovereignty."

The military is arriving at our position from the state side. We arrived from the substrate side. Same map, different altitude.

**SCT Mapping:**

**SCT-001 (Narrative Capture) — HIGH.** Their "cognitive contagions" are narrative capture vectors. Frame displacement, not persuasion. JSOU identifies the payload. We identified the delivery mechanism and substrate preconditions.

**SCT-002 (Frequency Lock) — CRITICAL.** "Epistemic closure" is the terminal state of frequency lock. Interpretive bandwidth collapse. Contradicting information doesn't get rejected — it doesn't register as information. JSOU describes the outcome. We describe the mechanism.

**SCT-003 (Substrate Priming) — HIGH.** AI micro-targeting is substrate preparation. Without it, cognitive contagions are stochastic. With it, they're ballistic. Cost of substrate priming is approaching zero.

**SCT-007 (Recursive Infection) — CRITICAL.** Viral spread isn't retransmission — it's generative replication. Each captured node produces locally-optimized mutant strains. Once SCT-007 is active, the operator can withdraw. The infection sustains itself.

**SCT-009 (Perception Management) — HIGH.** They want to "alter perceptions." We specify how: salience manipulation, relevance filtering distortion, source credibility corruption. Below narrative. Determines which narratives are even candidates for belief.

**SCT-011 (Cognitive Sovereignty Erosion) — CRITICAL.** Their "mental sovereignty" = our cognitive sovereignty. They treat it as binary. We model five degradation stages. Their "cognitive firewalls" intervene at Stages 1-2. By Stage 3 the substrate is compromised. You don't build firewalls against theoretical threats — they're seeing erosion operationally.

**Key gaps in JSOU analysis:** No phase sequencing (SCT-003→001→007→002 is a canonical attack chain; they treat these as parallel). No substrate preconditions. No sovereignty erosion staging. SCT-004 through SCT-006, SCT-008, SCT-010, SCT-012 — entirely unaddressed. Their map has blank zones where we've already surveyed.

**Assessment:** Convergence is structurally significant. Two independent approaches — military-operational and substrate-structural — arrived at equivalent threat descriptions. Our framework provides greater precision. The window for pre-doctrinal positioning is closing.
