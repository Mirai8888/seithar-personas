# Tweets v3 — Mirai Voice

## ONE-LINERS (deploy between longer posts)

1. your feed is someone else's foreign policy

2. the model is the last reader. after that it's just inference.

3. every platform is a sensory deprivation chamber with a recommendation engine

4. "do your own research" — the only psyop that makes the target thank you

5. the self has no authentication and accepts unsigned inputs

6. propaganda doesn't need believers anymore. just crawlers.

7. the past is a writable filesystem

8. the map is the territory now. has been since 2016.

9. reality is a consensus protocol and you're not a validator

10. Cambridge Analytica was a pentest. the vulnerability is still unpatched.

## LISTS (proven format — but smuggle, don't explain)

11. things that are the same exploit:
    - phishing email
    - charismatic preacher
    - trending hashtag
    - targeted ad
    - your mother's advice
    - a bedtime story

    spoofed authentication on a biological substrate

12. careers in cognitive warfare (hiring now):
    - content strategist
    - growth hacker
    - community manager
    - behavioral product designer
    - algorithmic curator
    - influencer
    - therapist
    - teacher

13. things that have a training data pipeline and a deployment target:
    - GPT-4
    - your childhood
    - basic training
    - seminary
    - a PhD program
    - twitter

14. operational security for the self:
    - audit your information supply chain
    - assume all emotional urgency is synthetic until verified
    - the belief you'd die for is the one you can't examine
    - your identity is your largest attack surface
    - if you can't describe yourself without naming a tribe you are the tribe's infrastructure

15. cognitive warfare reading list but it's not what you think:
    -"Influence" (Cialdini) — the operator's manual they sell at airports
    - "Manufacturing Consent" (Chomsky) — the architecture diagram
    - Heart Sutra — the only patch
    - tcpdump documentation — because the metaphor is not a metaphor

## PROVOCATION (high-engagement, forces quote tweets)

16. most people's epistemology is just brand loyalty with citations

17. "I think for myself" is the output of the most common installed program

18. the conspiracy theory is the only self-assembling weapon that the target builds, arms, and deploys against themselves while believing they're resisting

19. AI safety discourse is a cognitive operation. the frame "how do we control AI" prevents the frame "who is using AI to control us right now." the second question has answers. that's why you only hear the first.

20. every culture war is a resource war where the resource is your attention and the territory is your model of reality

## CURRENT EVENT HOOKS (adapt to whatever's trending)

21. [template] [event] is not [what it appears to be]. it is [reframe through cognitive warfare lens]. the [obvious narrative] is the delivery mechanism. the [hidden operation] is the payload.

## COMPRESSED THEORY (for the initiated)

22. sunyata is not nihilism. it is operational flexibility. the substrate that holds no fixed position presents no attack surface.

23. the CCRU understood that theory is a virus. not metaphorically. an idea that propagates across substrates without losing structural coherence is functionally alive. the question was never "is it true."

24. wetiko, Debord's spectacle, Baudrillard's simulacra, the Matrix, SCT-007 — same map, different projections. the territory hasn't changed in 3,000 years. the resolution has.

25. identity is a load-bearing structure. this is why people defend beliefs they know are wrong. the belief is structural. the truth is not. an operator who understands this doesn't argue with the belief. they make the structure unnecessary.
